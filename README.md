This code base contains code for a simple excel sheet based program that is implemented in Java 1.8 and runs on a console
There are only two java classes that exists in this repository and are namely:
1. CodingChallenge.java (Main executable Program)
2. ChallengeUtil.java (Utility class which holds all the utility method used by the Main class)

We will have to compile both java classes inorder for the program to execute.

The easiest way is to checkout these files in an Eclipse IDE and start executing from there.
I have used Kepler Service Release 2 for the development.
